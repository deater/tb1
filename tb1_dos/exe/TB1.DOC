 1.0  SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------------------------------------------------
      Bare Minimum:
           286/ 400K RAM/ 500K disk space
      To run at a reasonable speed:
           386 33Mhz or better
      For Digitized Sound:
           XMS RAM, Sound Blaster or Compatible sound card

      (I have been developing this on a 386 33Mhz and it runs
       passibly.  It runs so much smoother on a 486.  I'll try
       to optimize the code some more...)


 2.0  STARTING THE GAME
---------------------------------------------------------------------
      Make sure all the files are in the same directory (list below)
           [if any are missing, you will get a run-time error]

      Run the TBSETUP configuration utility.  Pick the appropriate
           options.

      Type TB1 to run the game.  See "TROUBLESHOOTING" if you encounter
           any errors.


      To run Tom Bombem off of a CD-ROM:
           Either type "tb1 -cdrom" to start the program in read-only
           mode, or say "y" when prompted if you want read-only mode.
           In this mode there are no saved games and the high score
           list will not change.

      Files Needed:
         TB1.EXE      - Main executable
         TBSETUP.EXE  - Setup Program

 3.0  THE STORY
---------------------------------------------------------------------

      To understand the game, pick the "Story" option off of the
      main menu.  This part of the game took a lot of time in
      itself, and is fun to read.

      The "Audio Error!" is not a real error.  I just saved myself
      the trouble of recording a voice-track for the game.  As many
      friends have said, "That's cheating!" but anyway unless I had
      a lot of time and a CD-ROM, it is not practical.

      Anyway in the story, any key will speed up most scenes, and
      escape will quit the whole thing.

 4.0  GAME PLAY
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
      To begin the game, select "NEW GAME" at the main menu.

      A little humorous movie will show; press <esc> to skip.

      The game itself is pretty simplistic as of yet.  Basically
      shoot the things coming at you.  The arrow keys manuever...
      the manuevering takes a little bit of practice to master.
      Space shoots.  You can shoot up to two missiles at once.
      "S" toggles sound.  "P" pauses.  If the game play is too fast,
      try the "+" and "-" keys to adjust.  Sorry, if it runs too
      slow at the onset, then your computer is too slow.

      The first level culminates with a "boss" character.  Read the
      story and see what happens.  The dialog will clue you into 
      what's happening.

      The second level is now totally finished.  Be sure to save 
      your games whenever you start a new level!

      Levels three and four are currently under development.  In
      level three, use the arrow keys to "walk" around.  The space
      bar will fire a weapon if you've picked one up.  To activate/
      pick up things, walk into them.

      Level four is similar to level two.  (Actually they are based
      on the same game engine).  They will be finished by version 2.5.

      An undocumented featue: when your score reaches a multiple of
      400 your shields are increased by one.

   Basic Summary of Keyboard Commands:

      ARROWS Manuever
      SPACE  Fires
      <ESC>  Exits
      P      Pauses
      S      Toggles sound on/off
      +      Slows down game speed
      -      Increases game speed
      F1     Shows help message
      F2     Saves the Game (see "SAVING/LOADING GAMES")

 5.0  SAVING/ LOADING GAMES
---------------------------------------------------------------------
      You can save games.  However the only part that is saved is
      how you begin the level.  Therefore there is no real purpose
      to saving your game until you reach level two.

      This might seem annoying, but at this point it is the only
      practical way to implement saved games.
      

 6.0  TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------------------------------------------------------------
      This program usually runs fine on most computers.  Occasionally  
      it will lock up on my brother for some inexplicable reason.
      If it locks up frequently, try playing without sound blaster
      sounds.

      Possible Problems:

         RUNTIME ERRORS:  (Characterized by a "Rumtime Error at 4454:3434"
                          message.)  Either a genuine bug or else one of
                          the ".TB1" graphics files is missing.

         LOCKING UP    :  If you have a sound blaster, try configuring
                          without SOUND, using the "TBSETUP" utility.

         MEMORY ERRORS :  If you want soundblaster sound, HIMEM.SYS must
                          be loaded.  Check DOS documentation.

         SOUND ERRORS  :  If you have a sound blaster and you are not
                          getting sound, be sure your "SET BLASTER"
                          command in your autoexec.bat is set properly.

         HARSH GRATING SOUND: This has happened occassionally at a
                          certain point on level two.  I've tried to
                          fix it.  If it's annoying, turn the sound
                          off.

 7.0  REGISTERING
---------------------------------------------------------------------
      My game is freeware.  There is no copy protection.  Hopefully
      if you like it you will let me know, by mail or by e-mail.
      A donation is not required, but if you want to you can send
      me one.

      I will be attending college soon (Fall of 1996) so my e-mail
      address, has changed from what it was earlier to:
            vmweaver@wam.umd.edu
     
      You can get Tom Bombem at its web site, 

            http://www.wam.umd.edu/~vmweaver/tb1/

      Also, a college education is expensive, so any donations would
      be a big help.

 8.0  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
---------------------------------------------------------------------
      I would like to thank many people who helped on this project.

      Ethan Brodsky for his excelent sound blaster routines.
      Get them at http://www.pobox.com/~ebrodsky/smix/smix.html
      There would be no sound blaster sound without them.

      The authors of PCGPE.  This program started out as a
      "flying toaster" demonstration from the Asphixia
      VGA tutorials.  I gradually replaced most of their code,
      but I still use their putpixel, waitretrace, setmcga and
      settext routines.

      I would also like to thank all my friends who have supported
      me, especially Gus Thompson, because she went to Spain and
      gave me time to work on this.  Also Marie Prosser for
      inspiration, and she also went away for three weeks
      allowing me to work on this.  Thanks to Nick Attanasio 
      who actually plays this game a lot, and whose comments 
      have hastened work on level 3.

      FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
             I am going to learn how to use Mode X vga programming.
             Supposedly this will speed up the code.  Unless you
             have a 386 like me, you probably won't notice.

             I'm also going to try to get some music in the 
             background, and of course add more levels.

             Also watch for a SGI gl port and possibly some
             sort of Linux port.  The only problem is that
             they'll have to be in C. ( :-( )


9.0  CURRENT BUGS (FEATURES)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

     Level One: No Known Ones
     Level Two: Locks up for no reason near end sometimes?
     Level Three: Many.  This level still is under development.
                Sometimes doors will not activate, sometimes
                they send you to the wrong room.
                Laser doesn't work, nor do enemies or
                radioactive flooring.  It is possible to
                beat it though.
     Level Four:Not done.  Right now is level two with different
                shape table.  

     LOOK FOR NEWER RELEASES TO HAVE FEWER BUGS.  

     If you find a unique bug, e-mail me describing it.


10.0  PRAISE/ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF TOM BOMBEM
___________________________________________________________________

     Supposedly it will be on one of Pacific Hi-Tech's
     "Gamehead" CD's.  We'll see.

     A German book company has offered to put it in a CD included
     with a Shareware Games book.

     Now Praise:


        "I just like it when it says 'Ahhh... Mr. Bombem.'"
                           ----Greg Grabowski, Bel Air, MD

        "It's simplicity reminded me of the early computer
         shooters... Kind of nostalgic... But the nice
         side [is] the very clever cinematic text."
                           ---->> Delance <<

        "The game is well designed but does not fit
         our current product line." 
                           ----Apogee Software Productions


Remember:  Watch for the newest version of Tom Bombem... and have fun.
