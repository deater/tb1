I had gotten multiple requests to put the game on CD-ROMs.

I always said yes, if they'd send me one of the CD-ROMs.
I never got any.

With the advent of https://discmaster.textfiles.com I can
see where the game was actually released.

version 2.2
+ "Universe of 3,000 Games"
+ "1996 Top Games"
+ "PC Collector 3 - Disc 2"
+ "ftp.gamers.org"
+ "Game Head 10"

version 2.1
+ "Giga Pack CD1"
+ "Kinjite Games 1996 November"
+ "Giga Games 5 (Walnut Creek)"
+ "Cream of the Crop 12 (Part II)"
+ "Shareware Extravaganza 8 Disk 3"
+ "1,000 Game Levels 2"
+ "The Best of Select Games 13"
